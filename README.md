#GiveHub

A Gemini-Powered Cross-Chain Fundraising Platform
üöÄ Project Description
GiveHub is a decentralized fundraising platform built to simplify the donation process. It leverages ZetaChain's Universal Smart Contracts to allow campaign organizers to accept donations from multiple blockchains (Ethereum and Solana) through a single contract. The platform features an AI-powered chat assistant, built with Google Gemini, that enables donors to make contributions using natural language commands. This hybrid approach offers both an innovative conversational user experience and a reliable traditional interface.

‚ú® Key Features
Cross-Chain Donations: Accept donations from multiple networks (Ethereum, Solana, and more) into a single smart contract on ZetaChain.

AI-Powered Donations: Use a chat assistant powered by Gemini's function calling to make donations via simple text commands.

Manual Donation Fallback: A traditional user interface is available for direct, manual donations, ensuring reliability even if the AI API is unavailable.

Unified Liquidity: All donated funds are managed within a single contract, simplifying the donation tracking and withdrawal process for campaign organizers.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Blockchain: ZetaChain (Universal EVM, Universal Smart Contracts)

Smart Contract Language: Solidity

Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS

Wallet Integration: Wagmi (for EVM chains), Solana Wallet Adapter (for Solana)
