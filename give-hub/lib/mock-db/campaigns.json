The shelter has been serving the community for 15 years and has successfully found homes for over 3,000 animals.

We'll offer free gardening classes and distribute fresh vegetables to local food banks and low-income families. The project includes partnerships with local schools for educational field trips and after-school programs. Over 100 families have already signed up to participate, and local restaurants have committed to purchasing surplus produce to help fund ongoing maintenance.",
