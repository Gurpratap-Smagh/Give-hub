## üöÄ How It Works

### Two-Stage Intelligence:

1. **Planner Stage**: 
   - Analyzes user intent with full campaign database context
   - Makes intelligent decisions about what the user really wants
   - Provides reasoning for its decisions
   - Has semantic understanding (e.g., "cool tech" ‚Üí Privacy browser, Youth coding)

2. **Executor Stage**:
   - Takes planner's decision and creates engaging responses
   - Has full campaign database knowledge for intelligent recommendations
   - Uses creative freedom to tell stories and make connections
   - Provides personalized, helpful responses instead of robotic data dumps

### Example Flow:
User: "yo suggest me a cool tech campaign" 
‚Üí Planner: Understands "cool tech" means innovative technology projects
‚Üí Executor: Presents Privacy browser and Youth Coding campaigns with engaging stories
‚Üí Result: Intelligent, helpful response that matches user's actual intent

## üîß Customization

You can override the default prompts by setting the environment variables:
- `GEMINI_PLANNER_PROMPT` - Custom planner behavior
- `GEMINI_EXECUTOR_PROMPT` - Custom executor personality

The system will fall back to the intelligent defaults if these aren't set.
